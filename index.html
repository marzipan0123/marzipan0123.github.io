            <p>
                Dynasty Goalkeeping Academy will run 5 weeks of camp at Saint Mary’s School in Raleigh,
                 NC during the summer of 2020. It is a 5 day residential program designed 
                 for the college bound, elite goalkeeper. We accept females age 13 or
                  older (students must turn 13 in 2020, hence a ’07 birth year) with
                   firm age guidelines for each week. Each week of camp will be limited
                    to 12 students to maximize results and to create a personalized 
                    experience for each individual.

            <h3>Goal Keeper Clinics</h3>
            <p>
                Dynasty Goalkeeping is available to run clinics at various times during the year 
                throughout the country. These are a great opportunity for students
                 that may not be able to travel to North Carolina during the summer,
                  (due to scheduling conflicts or expenses), to get a feel for the
                   Dynasty Goalkeeping Academy atmosphere. They are also a great way
                    to tune-up skills over the winter, in the off season, or between
                     camps offered during the summer.

                  about competing against others, but competing with ourselves and pushing 
                  ourselves to failure.  Through it all I never stopped having fun.
