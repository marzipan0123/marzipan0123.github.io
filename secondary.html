        <h3>Director of Dynasty Goalkeeping: Tracy Noonan</h3>
        <p>
            A potent combination of talent and tenacity carried Tracy Noonan
             (formerly Ducar) to the top of the women’s soccer world. Her 
             list of accomplishments includes a 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup
              championship with the United States women’s national team and 
              three NCAA championships with the powerhouse North Carolina
               Tar Heels. She also was a founding member of the Women’s
                United Soccer Association, backstopping a Boston Breakers 
                team that included USA and international stars Kristine
                 Lilly, Kate Sobrero Markgraf, Maren Meinert (Germany) 
                 and Dagny Mellgren (Norway).
        </p>
        <p>
            Not bad for a player whose career was almost derailed by a broken back
             suffered during a high school basketball game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since retiring as an active player, Tracy has devoted herself to 
            teaching and coaching, and was head soccer coach at Greensboro 
            College in Greensboro, NC before deciding to devote herself
             full-time to Dynasty Goalkeeping.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to her impressive playing resume, Tracy brings a strong 
            teaching background to her work with Dynasty athletes. From 1991, her
             freshman year at UNC, she has coached young goalkeepers through
              the Soccer Plus Goalkeeper School, founded by former U.S.
               Women’s National Team coach Tony DiCicco. After graduating 
               from college Phi Beta Kappa, with a degree in Biology, she 
               served as goalkeeper coach at UNC-Greensboro for the 1999
                and 2000 seasons. While head coach at Greensboro College 
                her teams finished second in the USA South Conference in 
                both the 2004 and 2005 seasons. She holds her USSF “A” 
                license and NSCAA Premier coaching diploma in addition 
                to being a NSCAA Goalkeeper Staff Coach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Success was not a given for the North Andover, MA native. Her back 
            injury and subsequent surgery made her sit out her junior season
             as goalkeeper for North Andover High School. Even though she 
             recovered to put together a 19-1 senior season and take 
             conference player of the year honors, college recruiters
              had backed off. She went to North Carolina, made the soccer 
              team as a red-shirt walk-on and battled highly-rated prospect
               Shelley Finger for the top goalkeeping spot over the next 
               three seasons. Despite splitting games with Finger through
                her senior season, she posted a 0.39 goals-against average 
                and got the starting nod for that year’s NCAA tournament.
                 Her clutch goalkeeping work helped the Tar Heels knock
                  off top-ranked Notre Dame for the Tar Heels’ ninth straight
                  ational crown. She was named the team’s most improved player
                   for the 1994 season, and took the first of her two career 
                   All-ACC honors. In 1995, she was named the Tar Heels’ MVP
                    and an NSCAA All-American.

        </p>
        <p>
            As a pro, Noonan (Ducar) won the Breakers’ Shield Award for community
             involvement in 2001, the same year she was inducted into the New England Sports Hall of Fame.
